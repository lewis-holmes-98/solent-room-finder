This is an ongoing project that will be used to support Solent's level 6 DevOps module. It is a room tracking application created using Next.js.

## Getting Started

- Clone this repository: `git clone https://github.com/joeappleton18/solent-room-finder.git`
- Next navigate into the created `solent-room-finder` folder: `cd solent-room-finder`
- Install the dependencies: `npm install`

### Setting up the database

- Get the connection string of your MongoDB server.In the case of MongoDB Atlas, it should be a string like this (notice how we've added rooms as the database name):

`mongodb+srv://<username>:<password>@my-project-abc123.mongodb.net/rooms?retryWrites=true&w=majority`

- If you are running MongoDB locally, it will look something like this:

`mongodb://127.0.0.1:27017/rooms`

- Copy the `.env.local.example` file in this directory to `.env.local`, which will be ignored by Git)

  - Set your `MONGODB_URI` with the the MongoDB connection string.
  - Set your `MONGODB_MONGODB_URI_TEST` database to `mongodb://127.0.0.1:27017/rooms` if you are working locally. Or, if you are using Atlas MongoDB Atlas, it should be a string like this:

  - `mongodb+srv://<username>:<password>@my-project-abc123.mongodb.net/rooms_test?retryWrites=true&w=majority`

- Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

- Run the development server: `npm run dev`

- **If you want to see the project stories**:, `npm run "storybook"`

### Testing

- If you want to run tests: Copy the `.env.test.example` file in this directory to `.env.test`, which will be ignored by Git)
- Set your `MONGODB_URI` with the the MongoDB connection string, use a different database to your dev database set above.
- Run the integration tests:
  - `npm run test` , to start the application
  - `npm run cypress:run`, to run the tests
